1. Backend API foundation

3. Listing lifecycle and search
   - Listing CRUD, public search, home feeds, and lifecycle transitions.
4. Payments
   - Listing-fee initiation, tenant premium initiation, provider abstraction, webhook processing.
5. Tenant retention
   - Saved searches plus email notification on listing creation.
6. Media
   - Signed upload URLs for Cloudflare R2.
7. Frontend delivery
   - Route-level views for public browsing, landlord dashboard, tenant dashboard, listing create/edit, and payment flow.
8. Deployment
   - Frontend Amplify config plus backend hosting on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Open items implied by the repository

1. Add or remove the missing seed script referenced by backend `package.json`.
2. Reconcile payment success copy with backend post-payment listing state.
3. Clarify or redesign `GET /users/:id`, because current behavior returns the owner of a listing rather than a user by id.
4. Add automated coverage for frontend route behavior and API integration; only backend node tests are present.
