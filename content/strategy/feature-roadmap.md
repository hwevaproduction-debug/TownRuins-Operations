## Known Technical Debt

Item

File

Priority

Frontend uses `PATCH /providers/me`; backend exposes `PUT /providers/me`

`providerApiSlice.ts`

🟠 High

Frontend uses `PATCH /rooms/:id`; backend exposes `PUT /rooms/:id`

`stayApiSlice.ts`

🟠 High

No provider settlement summary route (`GET /providers/me/settlements`)

`providerController.js`

🟠 High

`GET /users/:id` returns listing owner by listing ID, not user by user ID — misleading route name

`userRoutes.js`

🟡 Medium

`PUT /update/:id` and `DELETE /delete/:id` use non-RESTful paths with verbs in URL

`userRoutes.js`

🟡 Medium

Growing controller complexity — missing service layer abstraction

All controllers

🟡 Medium

`deleteUserAccount` transaction in `authController.js` is very large — should be extracted to a service

`authController.js`

🟡 Medium

Frontend automated test coverage is thin — only backend tests exist

`src/`

🟡 Medium

`docs/` markdown files were empty

`docs/`

✅ Fixed

`phoneOtpResendAttempts` is an in-memory Map — resets on server restart, not suitable for multi-instance deployments

`authController.js`

🟢 Low

`applyListingLifecycle()` runs on every `GET /listings` call — should be a cron job

`listingController.js`

🟢 Low
