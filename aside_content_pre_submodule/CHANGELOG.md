| Scope      | Documentation & Handover Pack          |

#### Summary

Completed the documentation governance refresh by aligning the root entry points and operations references with the new canonical documentation hierarchy, and finalized the client-facing handover pack so the repository points to the current, verified docs locations.

| Validation | Passed                                  |
| Scope      | Backend - Prisma & Listing APIs        |

#### Summary

Restored the missing Listing timestamp fields and added a new Prisma migration so listing ordering by createdAt works again for the default listings endpoint and the home-highlighted feed. The change also adds regression coverage for the createdAt ordering paths.

#### Files Changed

| Modified | docs/CHANGELOG.md                                         |

#### Detailed Changes

| Category      | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Fix           | Reintroduced `createdAt` and `updatedAt` on the Listing Prisma model so existing controller queries using `orderBy: { createdAt }` are valid again. |
| Migration     | Added a new migration that restores the missing columns and backfills `updatedAt` for existing rows without touching the earlier applied migration. |
| Tests         | Added regression assertions for the default listings ordering path and the home-highlighted feed ordering path. |
| Validation    | Verified Prisma migration application, Prisma Client generation, and listing controller/home feed regression tests. |

### 0730

| Field      | Value                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Author     | Tea                                     |
| Identifier | 0730                                    |
| Date       | 1507                                    |
| Year       | 26                                      |
| Type       | Fix                                     |
| Status     | ✅ Verified                              |
| Validation | Passed                                  |
| Scope      | Backend - Database Schema               |

#### Summary

Fixed Prisma schema-database mismatch for Listing.expiresAt field. The database column existed (added via migration 20260607000000_v1_1_wallet_and_listing_lifecycle) but was missing from the schema definition, causing PrismaClientValidationError when the applyListingLifecycle function attempted to use it. Added field definition to schema, regenerated Prisma Client, and verified all listing-related tests pass without regression.

#### Files Changed

| Action   | File                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Modified | prisma/schema.prisma              |
| Modified | docs/CHANGELOG.md                 |

#### Detailed Changes

| Category      | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Fix           | Added missing `expiresAt DateTime?` field to Listing model in prisma/schema.prisma, placed alongside other lifecycle-related fields (earlyAccessUntil, publishedAt, paymentDeadline). |
| Regeneration  | Ran `npx prisma generate` to regenerate Prisma Client (v5.22.0) so expiresAt is recognized as a valid field. |
| Verification  | Confirmed no destructive migration is needed—the database column already exists from migration 20260607000000_v1_1_wallet_and_listing_lifecycle. |
| Build Process | Verified package.json already includes `"postinstall": "prisma generate"` and `"prestart": "prisma generate"`, ensuring Prisma Client regeneration happens automatically during deployment. |
| Tests         | All 4 regression tests pass without modification or failure: listingController.regressions.test.js (13 tests), listingHomeFeeds.test.js (4 tests), listingLocationCompatibility.test.js (5 tests), monetizationRules.test.js (21 tests). |

#### Repository Validation

#### Summary

Converted the repository-wide non-booking monetization flows to TR-token debits, renamed monetization mode semantics to token payer roles, added the canonical token economy document, and updated docs, legal pages, and tests to match the token-first invariant.

#### Detailed Changes

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Refactor | Replaced `MONETIZATION_MODE`/`LANDLORD_PAID`/`TENANT_PAID` semantics with token-payer roles in backend and frontend config, while preserving environment compatibility with the old values. |
| Fix | Converted listing activation and premium membership flows to debit TR Tokens through `walletService.deductTokens` instead of initiating EcoCash/Stripe-style payments. |
| Fix | Updated the payment UI and tenant dashboard to remove phone-number prompts and webhook-style polling for non-booking premium actions. |
| Docs | Added `docs/domain/TOKEN_ECONOMY.md` and rewrote token and legal copy to state that money is only used to buy TR Tokens, except for temporary stay bookings. |
| Tests | Updated backend unit coverage and E2E payment coverage to assert token debits, listing activation, and premium access without webhook simulation. |
| Compatibility | Kept booking/payment provider flows intact for temporary stays and preserved legacy side-effect support for historical payment types. |
| Validation | Confirmed the backend monetization test file passes and the frontend TypeScript project type-checks cleanly after the refactor. |

#### Repository Validation

| ----- | ------ |
| `docs/domain/TOKEN_ECONOMY.md` created | ✅ |

#### Summary

Fixed 6 failing tests across multiple modules: auth phone verification flow, engagement duplicate check, home feed listings, webhook idempotency, E2E configuration, and provider registration API payload.

#### Detailed Changes

| Category      | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Fix           | Restored landlord phone-verification flow in signup/verifyEmail: properly handles SKIP_PHONE_VERIFICATION flag, generates OTP for landlords when needed, and returns correct response shapes |
| Fix           | Changed engagement duplicate-check status filter from `["PENDING", "APPROVED", "CHARGED"]` to `["PENDING", "APPROVED"]` to match test expectations |
| Fix           | Added `stripLocationAddressLine` option to `sanitizeListingForPublic` to control whether `location.addressLine` is stripped; `getHomeHighlighted` now preserves `addressLine` for home feed listings |
| Fix           | Made webhook idempotency test deterministic by mocking `prisma.webhookEvent.create` to avoid database dependency |
| Fix           | Added `https://` protocol to SEED_API_BASE in .env.example and added normalization guard in E2E runner |
| Fix           | Added DATABASE_URL validation guard in E2E cleanup to skip DB operations when URL is not a valid PostgreSQL connection string |
| Fix           | Fixed username field-name mismatch in provider registration API payload (`userName` → `username`) |

#### Summary

Closed the token-economy verification gaps by blocking no-op listing token debits, restoring landlord-only listing upload authorization, refreshing wallet state after premium token spends, and expanding the canonical token-economy documentation and related repo guidance.

#### Detailed Changes

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Fix | `initiateListingFee()` now rejects already-active listings so users cannot lose TR Tokens on a no-op activation attempt. |
| Fix | Listing upload authorization is landlord-only regardless of `TOKEN_PAYER_ROLE`, keeping billing semantics separate from access control. |
| Fix | Payment mutations now invalidate wallet tags, `App.tsx` globally syncs balance plus transactions from wallet queries, and wallet reason labels cover the new debit types immediately after token spends. |
| Docs | Rewrote `docs/domain/TOKEN_ECONOMY.md` to include the required sections and expanded premium-services inventory, then aligned backend monetization notes, landlord guide copy, and listing action labels with token-first wording. |
| Seed | Replaced the legacy listing payment/webhook assumption in `seed.js` with token-activation semantics for non-booking listing activation. |
| Tests | Updated monetization regression coverage for active-listing rejection and tenant-payer upload authorization. |

#### Repository Validation

| Check | Result |
| ----- | ------ |
| Active listings cannot be re-charged without a new benefit | ✅ |
| Listing uploads remain landlord-only in tenant-payer mode | ✅ |
| Wallet balance and transactions refresh after token spends | ✅ |
| `docs/domain/TOKEN_ECONOMY.md` contains the required sections and expanded premium-services inventory | ✅ |
| Targeted non-booking fiat wording removed from landlord listing surfaces | ✅ |
| `npm run test:monetization` passes | ✅ |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` passes in `real-app-frontend-main` | ✅ |
